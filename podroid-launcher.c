/*
 * podroid-launcher — sets PR_SET_PDEATHSIG before exec'ing QEMU.
 *
 * Why: ProcessBuilder.start() spawns QEMU as a child of our app process, but
 * Linux doesn't auto-kill the child when the parent dies. So when Android
 * uninstalls/reinstalls the APK (parent SIGKILL'd by the installer), QEMU
 * survives as an orphan under PPID=1 and keeps consuming RAM/swap until
 * reboot or manual kill.
 *
 * Fix: a tiny wrapper that calls prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, SIGKILL) before
 * exec'ing the real QEMU binary. The kernel then guarantees the child dies
 * with the parent, regardless of the cause (uninstall, OOM, force-stop, crash).
 *
 * PR_SET_PDEATHSIG is a Linux syscall stable since Linux 2.6, supported on
 * every Android version (9 through 17+). It is NOT cleared by a regular
 * execve, so the flag carries through into QEMU.
 *
 * Args:
 *   argv[0] = launcher path (set by ProcessBuilder)
 *   argv[1] = real QEMU binary path
 *   argv[2..] = QEMU arguments
 *
 * Build (mirrors podroid-bridge):
 *   ${CC} --sysroot=${LLVM}/sysroot -target aarch64-linux-android28 \
 *       -fPIE -pie -Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384 \
 *       podroid-launcher.c -o libpodroid-launcher.so
